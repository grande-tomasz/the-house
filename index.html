      <section class="lyrics">
        <p class="verse">
          Who is in that house?<br>
          I opened the door to see<br>
          Who is up the stairs?<br>
          I’m walking up foolishly<br>
        </p>
        <p class="pre-chorus">
          And at the end of the hall was a door<br>
          And I got pulled in by a sound<br>
          But I wish I’d never found<br>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          In the privacy of your own room<br>
          Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom<br>
          Where I just don’t understand<br>
          In the privacy of your room<br>
          Look away now, look away now<br>
          At the moon<br>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
          Is somebody watching me?<br>
          You really shouldn’t see<br>
          Why did you climb that last stair<br>
          You found me unaware<br>
        </p>
        <p class="pre-chorus">
          What I’m doing now it’s my own<br>
          And I don’t want it to be known<br>
          And it has to just remain<br>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          In the privacy of my own room<br>
          Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom<br>
          Where you just don’t understand<br>
          In the privacy of my room<br>
          Look away now, look away now<br>
          At the moon<br>
        </p>
        <p class="outro">
          Puzzle me now with mystery clothes<br>
          These apples I love, these apples I loath<br>
          And always forgive the future to come<br>
          For stealing the light from the sun<br>
